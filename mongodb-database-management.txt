Creating and managing databases and collections


Document: A document is a basic unit of storing data into the database. A single record of a collection is also known as a document. Basically, It is a structure that compromises key & value pairs which is similar to the JSON objects. Documents have a great ability to store complex data. For example:


const user = {firstname:"rk",lastname:"patel",age:22}


here firstname , lastname , age is fields and their values are rk , patel , 22.


Database: The MongoDB database is a container for collections and it can store one or more collections. It is not necessary to create a database before you work on it. The show dbs command gives the list of all the databases. 

show dbs command gives us all the databases list


Creating a Database:
In MongoDB, we can create a database using the use command.: use users


How to view all the existing database?
In MongoDB, we can view all the existing database using the following command:

show dbs


Creating a Collection:
In MongoDB, a new collection is created when we add one or more documents to it. We can insert documents in the collection using the following methods:

Inserting only one document in the collection
db.myNewCollection1.insertOne( { name:"rk" } )

Here,  created a collection named as myNewCollection1 by inserting a document that contains a name field with its value in it using insertOne() method.


Inserting many documents in the collection:
db.myNewCollection2.insertMany([{name:"rk", country:"India"},
                                {name:"vk", age:20}])
Here,  created a collection named as myNewCollection2 by inserting two documents using insertMany() method.
